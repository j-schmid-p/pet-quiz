# pet-quiz
quiz game about dog and cat health and how to take care of them.

**I deliberatly made this program using only one class**

This is a multiple-choice quiz, whith 3 possible answers for each question that works by terminal. 
When the user types an unexpected answer (for example A, B or C is expected but the user typed "N") the question gets asked again until the answer is valid.
All user-input is case insensitive.
If 3 consecutive answers are incorrect, the game ends. 
At the end of the game, the percentage of correct answers will be calculated and displayed.

Have fun!!
